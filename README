This is to give a small example of a PYTHONPATH problem.

This works (run in root directory):

PYTHONPATH=parser python -m pytest test/parser_test.py 

This doesn't work (run in root directory):

$ python -m pytest test/parser_test.py
>       assert 2 == parser.f(1)
E       AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'f'

test/parser_test.py:4: AttributeError
