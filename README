This is to give a small example of a PYTHONPATH problem.

This works (run in root directory):

$ PYTHONPATH=abcd python -m pytest test/abcd_test.py

This doesn't work (run in root directory):

$ python -m pytest test/abcd_test.py
:
:
test/abcd_test.py:1: in <module>
    import abcd
E   ImportError: No module named abcd

Which is not too surprising. However in other branches we add the directory to the sys.path.

Sometimes that "works" and sometimes it doesn't.
